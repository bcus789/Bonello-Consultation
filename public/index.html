                I am a currently active University Professor at The Ohio State University with more than 30 years academic experience, conducting top level research on tree health, from molecules to ecosystems, at top research institutions around the world, including Oxford University and the University of California at Berkeley and Davis.  I am an expert on emerging and re-emerging diseases of trees, and biological invasions of forests (both natural and urban) by alien (exotic) disease-causing agents.  I have taught or co-taught University-level forest health courses for the past 20 years and have published over 90 original research papers in top peer-reviewed journals.

              I can provide professional recommendations when an expert opinion is required, for example when a homeowner or a business owner would like a second opinion after an arborist has made his or her own recommendations regarding, for example (but not limited to):



              <!-- My research interests range from understanding the molecular
                mechanisms of tree-pathogen interactions to ways to harness such
                knowledge to improve forest health management. I have conducted
                fundamental research to try and elucidate basic mechanisms of
                resistance, the phenomenon known as systemic induced resistance
                (SIR) in trees against pathogens and insects, and
                cross-induction effects between fungal pathogens and insects
                mediated by the host tree. A recent and very exciting derivation
                of this fundamental work has been the development of
                spectroscopic techniques to rapidly and non-destructively
                phenotype trees for resistance to invasive pathogens causing
                diseases of great significance, such as sudden oak death in
                California, white pine blister rust in the Pacific Northwest,
                and ash dieback in Europe. For this work, in 2019 I received an
                award for Outstanding Innovation from the Reduce Risk of
                Invasive Species Coalition. -->

            <p class="blurb">
              In the last few years I have also developed an intense interest in
              advocating for the fundamental role of tree resistance research
              and deployment for the rational management of invasive tree
              pathogens and pests and, as an important derivation, for a radical
              change in how government handles management of invasive tree
              pathogens and pests. This activity has resulted in the formulation
              of coherent plans for the end-to-end management of such scourges,
              from how to handle potential sources of pests abroad to the best
              approaches to restore affected ecosystems. Besides my role as a
              faculty in Plant Pathology, I am a member of the Center for
              Applied Plant Sciences, the Environmental Science Graduate
              Program, the Infectious Disease Institute, and the Sustainability
              Institute.
